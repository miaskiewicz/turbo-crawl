# turbo-surf docs

turbo-surf is a single native (Rust) engine — there is no per-module JS reference
anymore (the engine is Rust; its modules are crates). Start here:

## Overview & product
- [`../README.md`](../README.md) — what it is, install, the MCP server, the
  Playwright drop-in, and the benchmarks.
- [`../CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) — what shipped.
- [`../PUBLISHING.md`](../PUBLISHING.md) — how releases cut (npm launcher + crates).
- [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) — working rules for contributors.

## Engine (the Rust workspace)
- [`../rust/README.md`](../rust/README.md) — the 7-crate workspace, the tiers
  (net/crawl → view/extract → V8 render), and how they fit.
- [`../rust/HEADLESS-HYDRATION.md`](../rust/HEADLESS-HYDRATION.md) — the no-browser
  JS render tier (a `deno_core` V8 isolate over the native rtdom DOM + the vendored
  `browser_env` binding).
- [`../rust/crates/turbo-surf-napi/README.md`](../rust/crates/turbo-surf-napi/README.md)
  — the dev/harness in-process addon (not published).

## Agent & test surfaces
- **MCP server** — 60 tools over stdio; see the "MCP server" section of
  [`../README.md`](../README.md).
- **Playwright drop-in** — [`../rust/playwright-shim/LIMITATIONS.md`](../rust/playwright-shim/LIMITATIONS.md)
  is the per-method coverage map (what's supported / no-op / throws).

## Harness (benchmarks, live network)
- [`../harness/competitive/README.md`](../harness/competitive/README.md) —
  same-script parity + timing vs real browsers.
- [`../harness/crawlers/README.md`](../harness/crawlers/README.md) —
  crawler-vs-crawler throughput.
