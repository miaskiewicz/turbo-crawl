"""turbo-surf — browserless, native-speed web crawler + extractor (PyO3 binding).

Pass a page's HTML in, get a view out — Markdown, visible text, links, a typed
extraction, an accessibility tree — or, for JS-gated pages, the hydrated HTML
after the page's own scripts run in a real V8 isolate (no headless browser).

    import turbo_surf as ts

    html = open("page.html").read()
    print(ts.markdown(html, base_url="https://example.com/"))
    print(ts.links(html, base_url="https://example.com/"))

    # Typed extraction: a schema maps field names to selector specs.
    schema = '{"title": {"selector": "h1"}, "prices": {"selector": ".price", "list": true}}'
    print(ts.extract(html, schema, base_url="https://example.com/"))

    # JS-gated page: run its own scripts and read the hydrated DOM.
    hydrated = ts.render(html, script, base_url="https://example.com/")

Fatal faults (malformed schema JSON, a render-tier failure) raise
:class:`TurboSurfError`; the non-JS views never raise.
